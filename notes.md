# Fix needed:

+ When inviting members to the team, prevent from inviting same email twice.
    * Ask for Email confirmation
    * Admin can remove member from the workspace, and invite another member instead.
    * Admin can add aditional team member to the team

+ Let the users chose if they want to charge automatically or send an invoice (Put the unsubscribe button in the admin dashboard - this will cancel the next subscription payment, but the current will remain active till it expires).

+ Test for resubscription.
+ Every additional team member is 10 â‚¬ per month
